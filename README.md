# NNTU Android app
Source code of our Android app. We have been working on it for a year now, so many pieces of code may be dumb (we didn't know many things back then), but at least it works for now
The Android version was made after the iOS one, the code is mostly similar except for some changes.

## What does it do?
This app helps students with navigation around the university buildings, get marks, timetable and news quickly.
